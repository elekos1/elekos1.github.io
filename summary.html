        <h1>Book Summary</h1>
        <p>&emsp; Harry Potter’s parents were killed in a car crash… or so he was told. They were actually killed by the evil wizard Voldemort. Voldemort attempted to kill Harry with the killing curse, but instead left Harry with a lightning bolt scar and a mysterious connection. Eleven years later, Harry goes to The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he learns about wizardry and battles Voldemort. </p>
        <p>&emsp; In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Voldemort returns to power and regains his original body. Harry realizes that his connection with Voldemort is more serious than he thought. He is able to see through the perspective of Voldemort and his snake Nagini, although sometimes the visions he has are just nightmares. Harry’s new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, Dollores Umbridge, like the Ministry of Magic, doesn’t believe Voldemort is a threat. So, Harry teaches other students defense spells so they can be prepared. </p>
        <p>&emsp; Harry dashes to help when he sees his godfather Sirius being tortured by Voldemort. This is different from his usual nightmares in the mysterious corridor in the Ministry of Magic. It’s too late when he realizes that it’s all a trap. Voldemort had used Sirius and given Harry the nightmare to lure him in... </p>
