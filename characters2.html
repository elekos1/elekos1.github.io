            <p>Fred and George -- also known as the Weasley twins -- are 2 of Ron’s brothers. They are tricksters and always play pranks on other people. They are also entrepreneurs and have their own joke shop. They also are outgoing and always put plans into action, like when they flew out of Hogwarts on broomsticks to open their shop.</p>

        <div class = "character">
            <img class = "character2" src = "ron.png" alt = "ron" width = "300px"/>
            <p>Ron has red hair and freckles. He is Harry Potter’s best friend and doesn’t like to do homework. He is always complaining about the piles of homework he has! Ron is rather humorous and talkative.<br><br></p>

        <div class = "character">
            <img class = "character2" src = "harry.png" alt = "harry" width = "300px"/>
            <p>Harry Potter is the main character of the Harry Potter series (obviously!). The Dark Lord, aka Voldemort, tried to kill Harry when he was a baby with the killing curse. Harry gained dark powers and went on to battle Voldemort until Voldemort was defeated in the Battle of Hogwarts (I think that’s what happened).</p>
