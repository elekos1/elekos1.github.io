            <p>Dobby the (free) house-elf can often be found with several wooly hats on top of his head. He was freed by Harry Potter from the not-so-great Malfoy family. He mostly helps Harry with big tasks and is very cute and dedicated.</p>

            <p>Luna can often be found with radish earrings and a necklace made from butterbeer corks. She is very curious and is strange in a good way (she carries around things in her bag like little plants that look like green onions!!). She tells uncomfortable truths, but is very relatable.</p>

        <div class = "character">
            <img class = "character2" src = "hermione.png" alt = "hermione" width = "300px"/>
            <p>Hermione can often be found reciting spells or studying under her bushy brown hair. Hermione is a top-student and studies pretty much night and day. She is a friend of Harry and Ronâ€™s. </p>
